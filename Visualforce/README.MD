# Visualforce Maps
* Visualforce maps are interactive, JavaScript-based maps, complete with zooming, panning, and markers based on your Salesforce or other data. 
* The <apex:map> component defines the map canvas, including size, type, center point, and initial zoom level. The <apex:mapMarker> child component defines the markers to place on the map by address or geolocation (latitude and longitude). You can use the <apex:mapInfoWindow> component to add customizable information panels that appear when a marker is clicked or tapped.
